What is homebrew? It's a package manager. In other words is a "painless way" to install anything on Mac

Always install Homebrew in your Mac. Copy the command from https://brew.sh/

    $ /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

Now that homebrew is installed let's test it out. 

    $ brew 
    
   It should list out some basic default syntax of brew
   
 
Next we go ahead and install iterm2. This is a interactive Mac terminal alternate. 
    
     $ brew install --cask iterm2

Other tools for Development

    $ brew install --cask visual-studio-code
    
    $ brew install --cask alfred
    
    $ brew install --cask spotify
    
    $ brew install --cask evernote
    
    $ brew install --cask docker (this installs the complete docker desktop and you can enable kubernetes engine from within Docker Desktop)
    
    

Now adding some colours to the boring Terminals. 

Someone was generous enough for us to actually create a Git repo about the best colours and we can just use them 

    $ git clone https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k.git $ZSH_CUSTOM/themes/powerlevel10k
    
Saving it with the name of your machine 

    $ code reshu.itermcolors

Most importantly install Git. 

    $ brew install git
    
    This is just basic Git tools. To install GitHub Desktop 
    
    $ brew install --cask github
    
Managing our Terminal Shell with OhMyZsh!!!

    $ sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"\n\n
    
    $ code .zshrc
    
    $ git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-autosuggestions\n\n
